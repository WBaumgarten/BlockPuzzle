# BlockPuzzle
Quick puzzle game about moving blocks with an easy way to create levels
Currently there is only one puzzle and no way to select others, puzzle selection is hardcoded.

Creating puzzles: Create a text file in the "maps" directory. In the text file define the rows and cols first, then create the layout as follows, (use "puzzle1" as reference):
f. = floor
w. = wall
p. = player
b. = box
g. = goal
